# WebApp
ITransition internship task.

A web application that allows users to register and authenticate. Unauthenticated users do not have access to user management (can only access the registration form or authentication form).

Authenticated users see a "users" table (id, name, email , registration date, last login date, status) with users.
The table in the left column contains checkboxes for multiple selection, in the column header there is a checkbox "select all/deselect". Above the table is a toolbar with actions: Block, Unblock, Delete.
